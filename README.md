### Project Description
[It is a rover for under water inspection]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[The project outlines real-world challenges in underwater inspection, including the inaccessibility of many regions and the limitations of current methods, which are often invasive, resource-intensive, and disruptive to the marine environment. The project suggests that existing tools are inefficient, expensive, and not environmentally friendly for detailed underwater inspections‚Äã.]

## Technical Details
Mini Submarine Design: The ROV is compact, designed to perform detailed underwater inspections. It is equipped with advanced camera technology to capture high-resolution images and videos of underwater environments.
Material Selection: The external structure is assembled using 3D-printed parts and other materials, such as acrylic sheets and cylinders, chosen for their ability to withstand underwater pressure (at least 10 meters deep). Epoxy resin and O-rings are used to ensure water resistance.
Thruster and Propulsion: Motors are attached to thrusters, controlled by an ESC (Electronic Speed Controller), providing movement and control of the ROV underwater.
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages Used:

Python
C/C++
Frameworks Used:

RPi.GPIO (for Raspberry Pi hardware control)
OpenCV (for image and video processing)
Libraries Used:

Pygame (for user interface/control)
Picamera (for interfacing with the Raspberry Pi camera)
Scikit-learn/TensorFlow (optional, if machine learning is used for object detection)
Tools Used:

Fusion 360 (for 3D design and simulation)
Raspberry Pi OS (operating system)
Fluid Dynamics Simulation Software (for underwater movement/stability testing)
Thonny IDE (for Python development)
3D Printing Software (for prototyping parts)

For Hardware:
-Microcontroller/Computing Unit:

Raspberry Pi Model 3B (for controlling all hardware components)
Motors:

BLDC (Brushless DC Motors) with ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) for propulsion and movement
Camera:

High-definition waterproof camera (integrated with Raspberry Pi for real-time video capture)
Sensors:

Pressure sensors (to monitor underwater depth and conditions)
Power Supply:

Battery (suitable for underwater operations and long runtime)
Waterproofing Components:

Acrylic sheets and cylinder (for the body/chamber to house electronics)
Epoxy resin (for sealing and waterproofing connections)
O-rings (for ensuring water resistance in critical joints)
